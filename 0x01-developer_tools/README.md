Sometimes you might need to edit your website and see the result of changes without any delay. Google has designed a tool which is automatically built into Google Chrome browser. Chrome Developer Tools, or Chrome DevTools for short, allow users to fix issues in their code without leaving the active tab.

Chrome Developer Tools are meant to assist with front-end development. Basically, you can play around, fix styling issues on your website and review changes instantly. To use this tool as a playground for experimentation with code and styles, you should learn how to use Chrome Developer Tools.

Since Chrome tools are integrated into your browser, you don’t have to perform any additional configuration. These tools for web developers are highly recommended as they help you complete DOM-related activities, edit website’s style, debug JavaScript and improve website speed.

To inspect element on-the-go, you should right-click anywhere on the website (or select a specific element) and choose Inspect from the context menu, or you can use the inspect element shortcut. Press CTRL+SHIFT+C (for Windows) and CMD+SHIFT+C (for iOS) on your keyboard. You will open DevTools in Elements panel. Then, hover over the element to highlight it.

The Elements panel consists of three parts:

-   It contains the website’s HTML code.
-   It presents CSS styles that are applied to the website.
-   In the CSS part, you can also find the CSS Box Model, helping you quickly edit padding, content and margin areas.
## Why You Should Learn Chrome Developer Tools: Purpose and Use

You can’t deny the fact that these Chrome Tools save you time by allowing you to edit websites in your browser. If you still need more convincing, here is a list of ways you can improve your web development with DevTools:

-   **Panels:**  you can experiment with various page elements, retrieve information, but don’t forget that if you close your tab without saving changes, they will be lost.
-   **Efficiency:**  Chrome Developer Tools are integrated into your browser: you can edit websites without jumping from one tab to another.
-   **Debug JavaScript:**  you can reproduce bugs, pause your running code and find the exact moment when the script fails to execute properly.
-   **Optimization:**  you can run Audits and get a report of the website's performance. You will also receive tips on how you should improve the site's loading speed.
-   Focused on data science skills
-   Flexible learning timetable
